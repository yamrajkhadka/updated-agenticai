**Chuchi ji,**

Sometimes words aren't enough, but let me try anyway...

You came into my life and everything changed. Suddenly, saying "sorry" didn't feel like a burden - it felt like love. Calling someone "chuchi" wasn't teasing - it was an endearment. And being with someone who's a little darpok? That became my greatest joy because I get to be your protector.

**You make me want to be better.**

Every day, I wake up thinking: "How can I make my Chuchi smile today?" Every night, I sleep thinking: "I hope she knows how much I love her."

People don't understand why I apologize so much. But I do it because I never want you to doubt my love. I do it because your happiness matters more than my ego. I do it because you deserve someone who admits when they're wrong.

**And you, my darpok darling,** you make all the apologies worth it.

This Valentine's isn't just about chocolates and roses. It's about celebrating US. Our weird, wonderful, "sorry"-filled, nickname-loving, perfectly imperfect love story.

**Ma timilai duniya bhar maya garchu.**
And I'll keep saying it until the stars stop shining.

Forever and always,
Your Ghosu 💕

P.S. - Sorry for the long letter! 😅 (See? I can't help it!)

**Dear Chuchi,**

I call you darpok, I call you chuchi, but here's the truth:

**You're actually brave.** 🦁

Being vulnerable enough to love? That takes courage.
Forgiving someone who says sorry constantly? That takes strength.
Being yourself in a world that asks you to change? That's bravery.

Yes, you get scared sometimes. Yes, you worry. But you know what?
**You face those fears with me by your side.**

You're not weak for being afraid.
You're strong for not letting fear stop you from living, from loving, from being YOU.

**My "chuchi" is actually a warrior princess.** 👸⚔️

And I'm so proud to be loved by someone so courageous.

Never doubt yourself, mero maya. You're stronger than you know.

And whenever you forget? I'll be here to remind you.

Timi strong chau! Timi amazing chau! 💕
